Welcome to 'socks', a tool for Learning Center tutors to automatically generate their timesheets! Are you annoyed by having to fill out a paper each time you want to collect your part-time salary? With this tool, you can generate your sheets automatically.

You will need to install Pypdf, pip, and python for this script to work properly.

```
pip install pypdf
```

Usage:

```
python3 src/main.py

```


This will generate a properly filled in timesheet, that you can either print out and sign, or sign digitally! Generated timesheets are stored in the timesheet directory with a nice file name. Development is ongoing. I have plans to make this a web app, then distribue it to departments in my school! I hope you enjoy my piece of software!
